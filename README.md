# dog-lancer-mod
Deltarune mod that changes Lancer into a dog.

A tutorial to add this mod to your game:
1. Go to https://github.com/yoshifan999/dog-lancer-mod/raw/master/LancerZip.zip and to download the modded data.win and lang.
2. Extract LancerZip. Note: Don't put the zip into SURVEY_PROGRAM or you won't be able to extract it.
3. Copy both "lang" and "data.win" from inside the LancerZip folder. 
4. Open SURVEY_PROGRAM and paste the files. When asked, click the option to replace the files in the destination. You will require administrator permission.

And if all of that is done correctly, you should now have a pupper Lancer in your game.

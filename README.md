# dog-lancer-mod
Deltarune mod that changes Lancer into a dog.

A tutorial to add this mod to your game:
1. Download "data.win" and "lang.zip" by clicking on them above this message, and clicking the "Download" button.
2. Extract lang.zip. Make sure lang.zip is NOT in SURVEY_PROGRAM before doing this, as you won't be able to extract it there.
3. Copy the now-extracted "lang" folder, and delete the lang folder in SURVEY_PROGRAM. This will require administrator permissions.
4. Paste the "lang" folder into SURVEY_PROGRAM. This will also require administrator permissions.
5. Delete the original "data.win" from SURVEY_PROGRAM (not the one you downloaded, also needs administrator) and copy the one you downloaded.
6. Paste data.win into SURVEY_PROGRAM. Yes, this one requires administrator permissions too.

And if all of that is done correctly, you should now have a pupper Lancer in your game.
